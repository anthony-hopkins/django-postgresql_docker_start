# django_postgresql_docker_start

A simple way to enhance the Django/PostgreSQL/Docker development process. 

## Description

This project is used to create a more mature development process for Django web applications and/or RESTful APIs. It strives to do this
by leveraging Docker and PostgreSQL (A very common/mature relational database) in an easy to understand yet hyper flexible manner.

docker-compose is used heavily during the development process 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Django>=3.2.4 (Any version SHOULD work for just creating a base project/app structure)
* Docker version 20.10.21 (Any modern Docker version should work).

### Installing
* Ensure you are in a fresh directory where you are ready to start work.
* Copy the below string and replace <DJANGO_PROJECT> with your own project name.
```
curl -L -o tmp.zip https://github.com/anthony-hopkins/django_postgresql_docker_start/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && unzip tmp.zip && cp -a ./django_postgresql_docker_start-main/. . && bash ./dpds-setup.sh <DJANGO_PROJECT>
```
* You should now see a directory structure like the following:
```

```
